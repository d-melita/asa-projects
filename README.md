# asa-projects

Our 2021/2022 Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms projects. Made in collaboration with [Diogo Melita](https://github.com/D-Melita). Both projects were developed in C++ (our first experience with the language).

Our reports for both projects can be found in their respective folder (written in Portuguese).

## First project

Creating a program which finds:

- The longest increasing subsequence given an array of numbers, and the number of times a subsequence with the same length as the longest occurs in the array.

- The longest common increasing subsequence given two arrays of numbers.

## Second project

Creating a program which finds the lowest common ancestors of two nodes in an n-ary tree.
