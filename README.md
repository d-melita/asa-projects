# asa-projects

Our 2021/2022 Analysis and Synthesis of Algorithms projects. Made in collaboration with [Diogo Melita](https://github.com/D-Melita).

## First project

Creating a program which finds:

- The longest increasing subsequence given an array of numbers, and the number of times a subsequence with the same length as the longest occurs in the array.

- The longest common increasing subsequence given two arrays of numbers.
